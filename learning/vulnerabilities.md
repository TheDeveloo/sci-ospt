System Misconfigurations
Network assets that have disparate security controls or vulnerable settings can result in system misconfigurations. Cybercriminals commonly probe networks for system misconfigurations and gaps that look exploitable. Due to the rapid digital transformation, network misconfigurations are on the rise. Therefore, it is important to work with experienced security experts during the implementation of new technologies.

Out-of-date or Unpatched Software
Similar to system misconfigurations, hackers tend to probe networks for unpatched systems that are easy targets. These unpatched vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to steal sensitive information. To minimize these kinds of risks, it is essential to establish a patch management schedule so that all the latest system patches are implemented as soon as they are released.

Missing or Weak Authorization Credentials
A common tactic that attackers use is to gain access to systems and networks through brute force like guessing employee credentials. That is why it is crucial that employees be educated on the best practices of cybersecurity so that their login credentials are not easily exploited.
